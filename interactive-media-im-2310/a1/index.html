        <p><bdi class="styling-for-letterhead">This</bdi> design paper is a personal analysis of the interactive website <cite>Entropy Fractal Fantasy</cite>. It contains 
            information aboubt my personal interactive experience with the website, as well as some further research I have made. 
            The webpage Liquid Entropy is one of the interactive experiences of the website fractal fantasy.
            The word <em>interactive</em> indicates any type of relationship and exchange of information between two entities; the term has been adopted 
            in the design field to describe interactive products and media, where a digital action has a consequent feedback. 
            The word <em>Entropy</em> indicates more broadly the degree of disorder in a 
                system, a process of degradation to an ultimate state of uniformity. This can be applied to the
                concept behind Fractal Fantasy, as this website and all its pages, give almost total freedom to the user
                to interact with the website however they prefer to and as long as they like. I like to think of Fractal Fantasy
                to be almost a digital canvas, on which the user can use the website tools (such as controls, settings, 
                menu and buttons) to create further spaces, worlds, sounds, environments.

<h2>Week 2 Research</h2>


        <h4>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h4>
    <p2><pre>   <bdi>   W</bdi> hile navigating the website, I have taken notes about my personal experience with it and have summarised them below, including some personal 
        considerations. When landing on the website, I noticed that  the homepage is, in fact, a realistic 3D environment containing a material with a liquid 
        texture. This, together with a control panel on the right side of the page and a small footer aare the only visual elements that make the actual 
        interface of the whole homepage. When scrolling the mouse over the environment, I immediatey noticed that the liquid texture moves and follows the 
        movements of the mouse, creating some sort of ripples and bubbles over the interface. All these actions are also accompanied by audio, for a better 
        user/experience, interaction and feedback. I have noticed that every point in the environment corresponds to a note, and electronic sound. When moving 
        the mouse, we can hear different sounds and can almost create a musical tune or melody if we pay particular attention to rhythm and intensity!
        When moving the mouse towards the bottom of the page, we hear a low-pitch electronic sound, similar to a glitch, which lasts until we mmove the mouse 
        to another direction. Same thing happens when we scroll up, however in this case, the sound will be sharp and high-pitch, almost disturbing if the volume 
        of the speakers is too loud. If we move the mosue horizontally instead of vertically, the website will produce an error sound, very deep and slow which 
        soon fades out. In a similar way, when keeping the mouse in the same position for a while, the previous sounds cotinues to play until it slowly fades out. 
        At last, it's interesting to note how there is a very sharp and noisy background sound (similar to an alarm) which continues to play in the background 
        regardless of our actions.</pre></p2>

    <h4>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>
    <p2><pre><bdi>     A</bdi> fter playing around with the interface of the webpage, I have made the following descrete actions: 
        <ul>
        <li>Changing the settings in the control panel on the right side of the page. This allowed me to adjust the way the interactive elements appear on the page, 
and change the way in which I could interact with the digital environemnt. I have changed many times the mouse size, vibration rate, speed, 
light, delay feedback, entropy and reset button. Below are some videos showing how I changed the settings to get some interesting results. The 
videos below show the interface with default settings, the seocnd videos shows settings reset to 0, and the last one has settings brought up 
to the maximum (100).</li> 



        </ul>
       </pre></p2>

<!-- ------------------------INCLUDE VIDEOS BELOW ------------------------------ -->

    <p2>A second feature I noticed in the webpage, is the menu: it is made up of only boxes, scrolling from 
        left to right. Each box links to another interactive environment.
