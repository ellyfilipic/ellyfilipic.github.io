        <h2>Interactive Media A1 - Interactive Design Analysis of Liquid Entropy Fractal Fantasy Website</h2>



        <p>This design documet is an analysis of the interactive website <cite>Entropy Fractal Fantasy</cite>. It contains 
            information aboubt my personal interactive experience with the website, as well as more academic researh and considerations.
            The word <em>interactive</em> indicates any type of relationship and exchange of information between two entities (people, 
            computers, machines, objects lants, animals). This term has been adopted by design academics and practicioners to
            describe interactive products and media, where a digital action has a consequent feedback. To give a more practical 
            example, a user might interact with a computer by clicking on the mouse, scrolling a website or pressing buttons; 
            ni return, the computer will provide some kind of audio-visual feedback in response to that action (for example 
           by providing earcons, sounds, animations and other <em>interactive</em> elements that confirm or reject the users' aciton).
           When we like a Youtube video, we click the small like button, which in return, will provide some visual interactive feedback:
            it will activavte a short coloured animation and it will then become black or blue to confirm that the action is now
            complete and we have succefully liked the video.</p>

        

        <h3>Introduciton</h3>
        <p1>Merriam-Webster describes the concept of the word <em>Entropy</em> more broadly, as the degree of disorder or uncertainty in a 
            system, a process of degradation to an ultimate state of uniformity. 
            The website <em>Liquid Entropy Fractal Fantasy</em> is highly interactive: nearly every image, text, button and 
        controls can exchange much information with the user and provide audio-visual feedback. It also requires an understanding, 
        from the user, of the different audio-visual affordances of the website, from which the user can start their interactive experience
        with the webpage.</p1>



        <h4>What is an affordance?</h4>

        <p2>The term <em>"afforndance</em> was first introduced by American psychologist James J. Gibson in the study of 
            cognition <cite>The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems</cite> (Boston, 1966). Merriam Webster Dictionary (2023), 
            describes affordances more broadly as <em>"the quality or property of an object that defines its possible uses or makes 
            clear how it can or should be used”</em>. This concept has also been adopted more recently by design theorists, 
                in many interactive projects, including the audiovisual and web design fileds, to allow the audience to 
                better understand and engage with the content provided to them. 
               <cite>“Once the element has been noticed by users, the element should contribute to the knowledge about what action 
                is possible with the product/system, which is affordance”.</cite>(Jeon, 2019, p.2)</p2>

        


        <h4>Week 2: Personal Interactive Experience</h4>
     <p2>While navigating the website, I have taken notes about my personal experience with it and have summarised them below, including
        some personal considerations. 

     <strong>Homepage - Liquid Entropy environment: To delete: What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</strong>
        When landing on the website, I noticed that  the homepage is, in fact, a realistic 3D environment containing a material
        with a liquid texture. This, together with a control panel on the right side of the page and a small footer aare the only visual elements that
        make the actual interface of the whole homepage. When scrolling the mouse over the environment, I immediatey noticed 
        that the liquid texture moves and follows the movements of the mouse, creating some sort of ripples and bubbles over the
        interface. All these actions are also accompanied by audio, for a better user/experience, interaction and feedback.  I have noticed
        that every point in the environment corresponds to a note, and electronic sound. When moving the mouse, 
        we can hear different sounds and can almost create a musical tune or melody if we pay particular attention to rhythm and intensity!
        When moving the mouse towards the bottom of the page, we hear a low-pitch electronic sound, similar to a glitch, which lasts
        until we mmove the mouse to another direction. Same thing happens when we scroll up, however in this case, 
        the sound will be sharp and high-pitch, almost disturbing if the volume of the speakers is too loud.
        If we move the mosue horizontally instead of vertically, the website will produce an error sound, very deep and
        slow which soon fades out. In a similar way, when keeping the mouse in the same position for a while, 
        the previous sounds cotinues to play until it slowly fades out. At last, it's interesting to note how there is a very sharp and noisy background sound (similar to an alarm) which
        continues to play in the background regardless of our actions.</p2>
               



    <h4>My Discrete Actions: to delete, list each of your discrete actions.</h4>
    <p2>On the rightside of the webage there is a control panel, which allows me to adjust settings and change the interactive
    elements of the pae, including: mouse size, vibration rate, speed, light, delay feedback, entropy and reset button.
    Below are some videos showing how I changed the settings to get some crazy results when playing with the interactive 
    interface!</p2>
