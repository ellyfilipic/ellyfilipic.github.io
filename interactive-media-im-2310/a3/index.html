<title>A3 - Interwoven Feedback</title>
<!-- I HAVE INCLUDED BELOW THE MAIN COMMENTS OUTLINING THIS PROJECT. However, more specific comments explaining each specific interaction, element or component of the page, are added next to the related chunk of code, in each code document -->

<!-- I chose 2 principles to creare this project, from the list provided on canvas: Feedback (as a design principle) and Interwoven (as an adjective). I am using these two principles to create an interactive, audiovisual vintage experience. Therefore 'Interwoven Feedback' is the name I chose for this page. Therefore my research quesiton and starting point for this final experiment, is to further investigate how can audio help, enhance, narrate and contextualise web-based experiences for a more interactive and immersive feedback. 
- With this project, I am trying to better study and understand the roles, possibilities and opportunities that music (and audio more broadily) can play iin an interactive web-based media project. THere are not many examples of music played online, especially in websites, as music in this case is considered to be too distracting from the visual content (which happens to be the main focus of every website). 
- My aim is to create an audiovisual experience to provide complete audiovisual feedback the users' actions, when they trigger the specific interactive elements set on the page. The page has plain 2D images in the foreground and background, to create  a sense of field depth. The art style I took as inspiration is abstract ar, in particular Wassily Kandisky's paintings, which convey a sense of unconventional freedom and open up spaces and possibilities. (https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zwg9qyc/articles/zr7cdnb  )
- Users can interact with these elements, by simply clicking, dragging, and double cliccking on them, to receive different kinds of feedback in responsse to that specific action.

<!-- Part of the assignment requires me to write a 500 word written document to introduce, explain and justify the content of this project. Instead of including the 500 words in the page like an actual text format, I decided to divide the content into popus, in numbered order. Each popup follows the other one, to also suggest to users the best order in whihc they can interact with the page. -->
