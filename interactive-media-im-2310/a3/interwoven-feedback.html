<!-- I chose 2 principles to creare this project, from the list provided on canvas: Feedback (as a design principle) and Interwoven (as an adjective). I am using these two principles to create an interactive, audiovisual vintage experience. Therefore 'Interwoven Feedback' is the name I chose for this page. 
The aim is to create an audiovisual feedback experience to the users' actions, when they trigger the interactive elements on the page. The page has plain 2D images /sketches in the background, in the style of low-fi, paper mockups and wireframes, to keep the visuals clean and simple and focus more on the audio instead. Each of these 3 main sketches contain other interactive elements (that are shown as being coloured 2.5D items, to catch the viewers' attention.). Users can interact with these elements, by simply clicking, dragging, and double cliccking on them, to receive different kinds of feedback in responsse to that specific action. 
Interwoven feedback as well because audio and visual elements can be interweave and combine together on the web page to create a cohesive composition, with the aesthetic of abstract art. -->

<!--  500 words written reflection on the webpage prototype, adjective/design pair and interaction. 
  These refletcions are included in the page in the form of a short essay. By clicking on the "text" icon on the top right corner of the page, you can open a sort of slide-in, curtain menu  overlay that contains the essay. I decided to include this overlay effect, so that users can read through the essay only if thye are intrested. The main focus still remains the audiovisual composition. This way, when users click on the icon and open the essay, it's easy to scroll and read through the paragraphs and focus entirely on the written presentation. On the other side, if users want to focus on the composition, the essay is hidden and therefore they won't have any additional information overcrowding the web page. -->

  <div class="overlay-content"><p>This webpage prototype represents an abstract 2.5D diorama inspired by Wassily Kandisky’s abstract art studies. I chose this art style, and Kandisky’s works in particular, because I believe they are  a meaningful source of inspiration and starting point to create a simple yet effective interactive environment. There are plenty of affordances in these art references, to create abstract compositions that users can interact with to receive creative and effective feedback. When interacting with each shape, users will receive audiovisual feedback appropriate to the size, position and nature of that element (each visual element on the page plays an appropriate and specific audio track when users hover or click on that element.). Amongst the many shapes shown in the original painting, I only chose those that could actually provide feedback on mouse hover or on click. In particular, I chose circles, triangles and squares that could rotate, roll, translate, bounce and produce sounds as well. I then mixed these elements together to create an aesthetically cohesive layout that reflects the chosen art style, so users can better navigate and enjoy the creative composition. 
    I chose sounds that are copyright free and have also been edited in Reaper Daw, to make them sound realistic and diegetic, in relation to position, size and material of the visual object producing that sound.  In order to fake how spatial audio sounds like, and to deliver a better user experience and feedback, I added some post-production sound  effects like reverb, panning, gain and volume. This mimics the spatiality of sound in a real 3D environment, while rendering on the web an audio format that most users can have access to and easily load on their browsers. Interactive audio assets of the page include: 
    •	Earcons and hard effects that mimic real materials, like glass and plastic, movement sounds (like rolling and bouncing).
    I believe that, compared to the previous one, this audiovisual prototype better reflects the chosen pair. Audio and visuals interweave together in a playful way to convey audiovisual feedback. Compared to my first prototype, this one contains audiovisual interactions that work better together creatively and convey meaningful feedback.
