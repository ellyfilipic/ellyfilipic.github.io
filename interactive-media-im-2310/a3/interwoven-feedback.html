<!-- This prototype is called Interwoven feedback because audio and visual elements interweave and combine together on 
  the web page to create a cohesive, abstract and colourful composition that provides appropriate audiovisual when users 
  interact with its main interactive elements. 
I will add more comments next to each code section to better explain the interaction and elements-->

<!--500 words written reflection on the webpage prototype, adjective/design pair and interaction. 
  These refletcions are included in the page in the form of a short essay. By clicking on the icon on the top right 
  corner of the page, users can open a sort of slide-in, curtain menu overlay that contains the essay. I decided to 
  include this overlay effect, so that users can read through the essay only if thye are intrested. The main focus still 
  remains the audiovisual composition. This way, when users click on the icon and open the essay, it's easy to read 
  through the essay and focus entirely on the written presentation. On the other side, if users want to focus on the 
  composition, the essay is hidden and therefore they won't have any additional information crowding the web page. -->

  <div class="overlay-content"><p>This webpage prototype represents an abstract 2.5D diorama inspired by Wassily Kandisky’s abstract art studies. I chose this art style, and Kandisky’s works in particular, because I believe they are  a meaningful source of inspiration and starting point to create a simple yet effective interactive environment. There are plenty of affordances in these art references, to create abstract compositions that users can interact with to receive creative and effective feedback. When interacting with each shape, users will receive audiovisual feedback appropriate to the size, position and nature of that element (each visual element on the page plays an appropriate and specific audio track when users hover or click on that element.). Amongst the many shapes shown in the original painting, I only chose those that could actually provide feedback on mouse hover or on click. In particular, I chose circles, triangles and squares that could rotate, roll, translate, bounce and produce sounds as well. I then mixed these elements together to create an aesthetically cohesive layout that reflects the chosen art style, so users can better navigate and enjoy the creative composition. 
    I chose sounds that are copyright free and have also been edited in Reaper Daw, to make them sound realistic and diegetic, in relation to position, size and material of the visual object producing that sound.  In order to fake how spatial audio sounds like, and to deliver a better user experience and feedback, I added some post-production sound  effects like reverb, panning, gain and volume. This mimics the spatiality of sound in a real 3D environment, while rendering on the web an audio format that most users can have access to and easily load on their browsers. Interactive audio assets of the page include: 
    •	Earcons and hard effects that mimic real materials, like glass and plastic, movement sounds (like rolling and bouncing).
    I believe that, compared to the previous one, this audiovisual prototype better reflects the chosen pair. Audio and visuals interweave together in a playful way to convey audiovisual feedback. Compared to my first prototype, this one contains audiovisual interactions that work better together creatively and convey meaningful feedback. 
    I believe the audio tracks not always play properly when online, so I gues that's a bit of a shame, as my main focus was to provide meaningful audiovisual feedback, so that visuals and audio could interweave and work together to provide a better online experience.

    <!-- this is a container for black and blue circles. 
      As I wanted to add some personal taste to the composition, I shall say that these black circles with coloured 
      borders remind me of the diaphragm of a loudspeaker. Therefore each circle is considered as a separate, independant 
      speaker and plays a different audio track on mouse enter/hover. 
    Each circle overlays the others, to create a sense of depth perception. Therefore, depending on its position and size,
     the speaker plays a different audio track, as shown below-->

      usually expected to produce high-pitched notes; in this case a violin note) -->

      audio is not rendering properly when loading the page on the web. I tried using various audio formats, including

      in the compoisition, and seems to have no close relation with the surrounding elements (in the Kandisky's painting 
      as well as in this composition). Therefore I "treated" this element separately from the others. It is animated in 
      order to bounce off, out of the composition and produce a sharp bouncing soud. -->
