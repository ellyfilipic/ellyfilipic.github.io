<!--ALL COMMENTS HERE: 
- the customised filters I added to the page are: 
1) Difficulty level (rated easy/beginner, medium/intermediate, complex/expert)
2) Type of dish (entries, main dish, sides, dessert)
3) Ingredients (fruit, vegetables, pasta, meat)
4) Dietary (vegan, vegetarian, other)


- USABILITY GOALS of this page : 
1) effective (Does it allow susers to find what they want? My aim is to make the webpage as effective as possible, by reducing the amoutn of information displayed (leaving only the information important to the let the viewers understand the recipes. I also added more filters and categories to allow users to find what they're looking for in an easy way.)
2) efficient (How quickly do users find what they need? The filters, headers, quick info and recipe cards allow users to navigate the pages easily and quickly, by filtering information and find what they need.)
3) safe (is there an undo button, can yiu fix errors, eg: filters in the recipe website, don't allow users to go back and clear filters. Buttons are not clear, icons are small and hard to decipher and understand where they link to)
4) utility (relative to effectiveness, see canvas pdf)
5) learnable (provide contextual information that can provide learnign information, you need o provide people wih tools to learn and achieve their goals with your product. that's what people want, get to the thing, eg most often not interested in the whole website, they just want ot find what they need. Good design though might interest people in navigating a bit more). 
5) memoraibility (are funcitons easy to remember? provide users with memories about functionalities of your product, so that when they go back to use, they know what to do and where to find things)


- With regards to the style and design of the page, I am taking inspiration from the design, colour palette, UI/UX of the recipe website https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/feta_brined_roast_chicken/ 
- Colour palette chosen on: https://paletton.com/#uid=10L0u0kwi++bu++hX++++rd++kX   ;  https://imagecolorpicker.com/color-code/ffa800 and https://coolors.co/palette/001219-005f73-0a9396-94d2bd-e9d8a6-ee9b00-ca6702-bb3e03-ae2012-9b2226
- In order to filter the information provided and redesign the information architecture of the page, I decided to remove the Flickr links  (of the images) to make the webpage and recipes more realistic, as if it was a recipe written and published by a real author and displayed on a  website. 
- The preparation time for every recipe was written like this 00:10 - preparation time 00:30 . I decided to rewrite the time in minutes (or hours, depending on te recipe) to make it more clear,  readable and understandable. 
- I decided to remove the recipe-image-box div as the information it contained was either removed or relocated into other elements
- After making research on similar recipe and cuisine webpages, I've noticed that the most common serch filters (which is what users are after and expect to fin when navigating a website) are: dietary, preparation time and ingredients. I've tried to adjust and customise the filters for this page according to these results.
- I reorganised the information provided for each recipe into chunks of information: Headings, image, Info/description of the recipe. (layout ad grid are similar to simplyrecipes.com/recipes/ricotta_stuffed_chicken/ which I am using as a main source of inspiration for this page. I really appreciate how clear, clean and well organised the page is, even though it contains a massive amount of recipes and visual content)
- I decided to remove the recipe-image-box div as the information. This is because I either removed the info it contained or moved it into other elements to make the layout appear more clear and readable. 
- I removed also the Flickr links and other attribution to make the webpage and recipe more realistic, as if it was a recipe written and published by a real author and displayed on the website. 
- I decided to include a clock icon to draw attention on the time needed to prepare each recipe. After making some research on similar cooking webpages, I noticed that this is a common feature, as users want to know in advance how much time is required to complete a recipe, even before starting to read the rest of the content (ingredients, servings, etc)
- For each recipe, I grouped together skill levels, difficulty, type of cuisine, type of dish and other information into a single, short paragraph below the image <div class="info">. This is additional information that users can read if they are interested in cooking the dish, however it's not pivotal content. That's why it's written under the image, at the end of the recipe card, and in a smaller size. The main attention is drawn on the headings (which already give an idea of the type of recipe and dish) and of course the image as well.
 - with regards to the Ui design and other aesthetic choices, I wanted the page to look classy and colourful while being at the same time as effective and accessible as possible. Therefore, I tried to get rid of the information I thought were not necessary, and organising the rest of the content into chunks and groups to make it clear and simple to read. 
 - in the original layout, all recipe boxes were stacked upon one another with no negative space left in between. This made it very hard to understand where one recipe started and where the previous one ended. So I decided to define each card with a background colour, border, box shadow, column and row gaps. I believe this makes it easier for the user to read and understand (effective, efficient, learnable and easy to memorise information)
 - Buttons, cards and filters all have on hover and on click effects (either colour change, or box shadow, or different border style) to give visual feedback to the user. This helps the user to understand that what elements are hovered on or clicked, helps to filter information and makes the navigation of the webpage easier. 
 - I wanted the filter section to be at the very top of the page, as if it was a dropdown menu from which users can easily navigate the page.
