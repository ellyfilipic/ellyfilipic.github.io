ALL HTML COMMENTS (REGARDING THE LOADING PAGE) ARE WRITTEN BELOW!: 

  PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK TO THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
  1) <button> with the id of load-link on the loading page (index.html). So I decided to customise this button to make it look very minimal, clean and simple. The "load page" basically consists only of some 
    text and an overline; it has the same background colour as the page background and has no border or radius (to keep it very basic and 
    essential). I also added some css code to style the on hover effect: on hover, the button scales down in size and the text becomes bolder, 
    adding an underline as well as an overline. I believe this gives good visual feedback to the user (who can clearly understand when the 
    button is triggered, on hover, clicked, or in default mode) as well as meeting the minimal aesthetics of the webpage.  
     
  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html). The load button becomes a load-throbber when it is clicked on. In order to redesign the bar, simulate a real loading bar and give feedback to 
        the user to ask them to wait for the page to load, I created a thin, basic loading throbber, with a black outline and a light grey background (same colour as the background page). I also applied some animation, 
        to simulate the bar progressing as the page continues to load. The animation allows the bar to get progressively longer as the page loads. 
        I believe this is a quick and effective way to communicate visual feedback to the user and simulate a loading page.  
        Usually, progress bars move from left to right, progressively and as the page loads; however, as the throbber is only simulating the loading progress, I decided to animate the bar so it can grow in length from the middle of the bar towards both directions (left and right).
