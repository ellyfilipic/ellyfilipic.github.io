<!-- about deisigning features, completing, changing, designing existing features and adding 1 of your own. 
  THink about their affordances and signifiers 
Customise the provided media player code (see Week 8 canvas module) through CSS styling and the addition of one extra feature of your choice.

Your media player must make use of the approaches laid out in the previous exercises, including attention to a defined and cohesive styling, responsive layout, visual hierarchy, relevant feedback and context appropriate usability.

Your code commenting should focus on the technical implementation and design choices related to your chosen extra feature including a description of why that feature was the most appropriate choice in relation to the context.

Your code commenting should reflect on your interface design - why is the extra feature you picked important to the overall usability?-->
